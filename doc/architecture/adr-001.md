# ADR 1: Use of local docker containers

## Context
Building the solution to the assignment course.
There was a worry about any connectivity issues during the presentation.


## Decision
I will use local containers instead any cloud solution.
I will download or build the images previously.


## Status
Accepted


## Consequences
* There should not be any problems with connectivity.
* Should be possible to demostrate the proposed infrastructure.
* It will not be possible to demostrate any autoscale process.
